   <h3><strong><em>Fullstack Developer</em></strong></h3> 
<br>
<p>Hi my name is Awate Amha and Im a fullstack developer.I currently finished my studies as a Java Developer at STOCKHOLM TECHNICAL INSTITUTE. During these studies, students
    are readied to become Developer.During my time at STI, I have completed several projects, ranging from software development to hardware
    engineering to web development, which has broadened my toolkit immensely. Within these projects
    I have acted in a leadership role as scrum master, acting close with the product owner to implement their
    needs into the product and further improve on current concerns. Acting in both major and minor roles
    within these projects improved my flexibility to work with tasks of different importance, as well as my
    collaborative problem-solving ability.</p>
